MIMAviz is a rewrite of the original [MIMA Simulation](http://ti.ira.uka.de/Visualisierungen/Mima/) in Javascript
using [Pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js). The original MIMA simulation/visualization app was a Java Applet
(written in more than 10 years ago) which doesn't run in most modern browsers any more.

## Features

  * Full functionality of the original [MIMA Simulation](http://ti.ira.uka.de/Visualisierungen/Mima/)
  
## Usage

Easy, choose the instruction you would like to visualize, then click *START*. Use the *NEXT* button to go 
forward, or use *SKIP* to fast forward to the next phase.
  
## Why Create MIMAviz?

To help my fellow students at KIT like me, who are interested in seeing the MIMA simulation/visualization but 
don't want to run a Windows VM. Also to practice my newbie JS skills as well as to try implementing GUI (HTML5 
Canvas!) for the first time. ;)

## Project Status

Now you can download the latest working version for a spin! At the same time I'm still doing some polishing 
though as the code is quite ugly and convoluted right now. 

A TODO list of some planned add-on features:

- [ ] Additional description for what each MIMA instruction does
- [ ] English localization (currently only in German)
- [ ] Pointer over button animation
